Descriptions:
    Since I decided to do multiple pages, I used local storage to save the data of player and mode. Created a function called gameLogic which 
    compares the values of 2 answers and gives us the result. With each option button click event, this function is called. For player vs player,
    used a boolean to keep track of the turns. To move to the ending page from the game page, the mode equals to the one in local storage and 
    player1/ player2 has the max amount of wins. The pathway when they click the next button is the end page. If it doesn't meet those conditions,
    when you click the next button, the game play continues. For the end page, I had to use session storage, since the counters 
    aren't saved in this new page. Session page saves data until the browser closes/ends.
